r/MentalHealth is looking for moderators,15,1e297nd,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1e297nd/rmentalhealth_is_looking_for_moderators/,20,"Hey r/mentalhealth! We're looking to grow our moderation team. Moderators are a key part of what makes any reddit community special. If you are interested in helping to make this community special, we'd like to talk to you.

# What do the mods do?

Moderators here on mentalhealth work to build our community and make this a safe place to discuss the many facets of mental health and the ways that mental health and mental wellness influence daily life. Moderators help to write the rules, respond to content concerns, set policies, update community themes and appearance, manage automation, and general upkeep.

# What are the minimum requirements to apply? Can I apply if I've never been a moderator before?

If you care about mental health and would like to be a part of our amazing team of moderators, then we'd like to hear from you. Prior experience is a plus, but not the most important thing we're looking for. We want moderators who care about mental health and the r/mentalhealth community, fit well with our team, and want to help.

If this describes you there are some steps below that we'd like you to take to apply. These steps include some open ended questions that we'd like your thoughtful answers on. Everything else that you might need to know we can help you learn along the way. If you're interested in moderating and want to get a head start on all there is to know, we recommend you [check out the reddit training offered here.](https://redditforcommunity.com)

# What are the expectations for moderators who join the r/mentalhealth mod team?

Mod team members need to be a part of the team. We need people who will engage and communicate about what they see and what questions they have. Our mod team is supportive and understanding. We know you have a life outside of reddit, and we expect you to put that life first. Sometimes that means you might have less time to moderate and that's okay. We expect communication and coordination so that we can support each other and bring in more help when we need to.

# Is there anything I should know about moderating r/mentalhealth before I apply?

Yes. r/mentalhealth is a support community for mental health and we often encounter posts and comments that describe traumatic experiences or crisis. Some of this content can be disturbing.

Our team policy is that when a post or comment is too much for one of us to handle, we let the rest of the team know and someone else will step in to handle it, *but there is no way to eliminate the exposure completely*.

If you apply, please expect that we will ask you about your comfort level in moderating content of this nature and what strategies you might use to make sure your own mental health needs are met.

No one is expected to address issues that are uncomfortable for them, but you should expect to encounter such things if you join the team.

Second, we require that moderators join our discord server, where we communicate and coordinate our moderation efforts. Part of the application process includes joining us on that server for a chat. You will need a discord account (can be an existing account if you have one).

# How do I apply?

If you are interested in joining our team, here is the process we follow:

1. Send us a modmail indicating that you are interested and include answers to the following questions:
   * What does mental health mean to you?
   * Why are you interested in being a moderator on r/mentalhealth?
   * In your opinion, what are some differences between a good moderator and a bad moderator?
2. We will review your modmail and your application. We may ask for some additional information about your moderation experience and how familiar you are with reddit. We may use a google form to structure those questions.
3. We will invite candidates we think might be a good fit to join us on our discord server so we can interact and get to know each other before making a decision on extending an invitation to be a moderator.
4. New moderators on the r/mentalhealth moderator team start out with a trial run that will last about four weeks. During that time, the trial moderator will have limited moderation responsibilities, both for evaluation and to help provide a structured way to get up to speed.

Thanks for reading, and we hope you apply!",1720873558.0
Politics and Mental Health,22,1e1m1i1,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1e1m1i1/politics_and_mental_health/,13,"Hello friends!

The team has noticed an increase in posts expressing concerns over politics. We have always intended for r/mentalhealth  to be a safe, politically neutral space for users, and we wish to keep it that way. We will be removing and locking threads that go out of hand with the political aspects of things.

Political anxiety is more common than you think around election time. If you are having trouble with political anxiety, there are ways to cope with the stress. Here are a few examples:

**Timeout**: Social media, including the news channels, are designed to have a negative tilt to collect views. They want you to keep coming back for more. It is an excellent idea to differentiate between thoughtful and stress-inducing, sensationalized material. It is okay to find out about news after it breaks. By waiting for accurate information and thoughtful analyses, you will be able to provide informative content for yourself. Limiting the use of social media to once or twice a day will be beneficial. If your political anxiety is still too much to handle, it might be time to take an extended break.

**Control**: The majority of what is happening in national and global politics is out of our personal control. Turning our attention to ourselves, our friends, families, and local communities can help us be empowered and productive. Engaging in activities you enjoy, such as hobbies, exercise, and time with friends, can be a healthy distraction. Practicing self-care through wellness techniques and programs can also help keep your anxiety in check. Here are some websites that provide helpful information and tips on self-care:

[MHA: Taking Good Care of Yourself](https://mhanational.org/taking-good-care-yourself)

[NHS: Self-Help Therapies](https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/talking-therapies-medicine-treatments/talking-therapies-and-counselling/self-help-therapies/)

[El Camino Health: Emotional Self Care](https://www.elcaminohealth.org/community/chinese-health-initiative/specialty-programs/emotional-well-being/emotional-self-care)

**Community**: Connect with individuals who provide a safe space for understanding current events. Sharing what you are thinking and feeling with trusted peers can mitigate the negative effects of stress.

**Engage**: The feeling of helplessness can be stressful and discouraging. Getting involved with a local political party, volunteering with a community group, or participating in activism can help you feel a sense of accomplishment, power, and purpose. These activities also connect communities of like-minded people, which helps to alleviate stress.

**If you are experiencing a crisis or medical emergency, please contact your local emergency services. We have a** [**list of resources**](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/wiki/index/resources/) **on our sidebar as well as a link to a** [**global index**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_suicide_crisis_lines) **of emergency numbers.**

If you have any questions, concerns, or suggestions feel free to make a comment in this thread, or [send us a modmail.](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=r%2Fmentalhealth)

My 7 month old daughter passed away from SIDS,61,1fs61jv,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1fs61jv/my_7_month_old_daughter_passed_away_from_sids/,8,"It’s the third day of being without my daughter. It feels empty. It feels too quiet. It’s like, the 7 months my fiancé and I spent raising her was a dream. Like it didn’t even happen. Yet I have videos and photos proving otherwise. I feel numb in the head. My fiancé has been crying more than I have. I feel so guilty that I can’t cry as much as her. I’m worried that she may think I loved her any less because I’m not crying as much as her. I’m sad that my daughter is sitting in a cold metal box until she can be autopsied. That I can’t just go grab her and keep her warm. That I can’t hear her laughter anymore. Everything just feels so surreal and I have no idea where to get back our happiness.
I keep telling my fiancé that things will eventually get better, but I feel like I’m lying to her. I feel that everything I’ve been telling her is a lie.",1727621301.0

I become violent and physically hurt someone when I'm angry.,22,1fsbr5b,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1fsbr5b/i_become_violent_and_physically_hurt_someone_when/,18,"How can I change this habit of becoming so violent that I end up hysterically shouting and hurting someone, only to regret it later? I never want this to happen, but whenever I get angry, especially with people I've forgiven but still continue to make the same mistakes despite my warnings—I lose control. Shouting and hurting someone feels like my **default reaction** when I get angry. I want to handle situations calmly and maturely, but it's really difficult. Of course, I always feel guilty after what I’ve done. Every action replay in my mind, and I always end up thinking, **""I shouldn’t have done that.""** I really don’t want to act this way, especially when I’m hurting someone. It’s never right, but I can’t seem to stop myself. 

For those who have been in a similar situation, how did you start changing, little by little? We can’t afford for me to get a diagnosis, so I’m not sure what my condition is or how to address it, but if I can save enough money someday, I will definitely get myself checked.",1727636123.0

On a physics exam I lost points for not rounding decimals correctly. My chess rating on chess,com went from 2000 to 1750 which for anyone that knows, is a massive drop. I wasnt able to add my change correctly at the grocery store. Im having lapses in memory too, such as using the bathroom, washing my hands and immediately after leaving, forgetting if I washed my hands or not, so I repeat it 20 times.  Or forgetting what I sat down to do at my computer. I cant do any of the things I used to enjoy anymore. I feel like Im just melting from the inside and the more frustrated I get with it the more I keep stubbornly trying which makes it worse. I dont know what to do. My life has always been dificult and the only way for me to compensate with my truama and lack of social skills was to use my intelligence as a way to find satisfaction with myself. without that I feel like there's no reason to continue trying, I would rather just rot away in bed 24/7. I have a lot of people that rely on me and I feel like just dropping my classes, quitting chess and other hobbies, and telling my students to find a new tutor.

being ugly as a boy,4,1fslasx,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1fslasx/being_ugly_as_a_boy/,2,"idk if anyone will see this or relate to this but all my life i’ve been ugly, i’m tired of convincing myself i’m not that ugly. Ever since middle school i’ve been insecure about how i look. At first it was my crooked teeth, then my skin going from light skin to dark skin because of soccer, and after that i got insecure about my haircut, then my outfits. Ive been called ugly more times than i can count, ive been made fun of for it from 4th grade to still now in 10th grade. 
i know i shouldn’t be to worried about my appearance but it still hurts. the same group of people who made fun of me growing up are all white kids. the stereotypical ice-cream hair kids and Lululemon girls pretty much bullied me into depression. after middle school i never saw them again but when i went to high-school i couldn’t look at white people the same again because they all look so similar to the point i pretty much get ptsd at that point when i get classes with mostly white kids.
i’ve changed my hair, my outfits, nearly fixed my acne, and nearly fixed my teeth but i’m still viewed as ugly to most. i don’t get why some of the most beautiful people are also the meanest. In the bible in Mark 11:25 it says “And when you stand praying, if you hold anything against anyone, forgive them, so that your Father in heaven may forgive you your sins” but this is the biggest grudge i hold and i struggle to forgive the group of kids that bullied me even though its been almost 2 years since i’ve last seen them. Even when i say i forgive them theres a part of me that doesn’t forgive them. Am i wrong for feeling like this? am i wrong for feeling ugly? or am i just going crazy? i genuinely don’t know which is why i’m sharing this because i’ve kept this all to myself for years.

I always wanted to be the easy kid for my parents, to remove myself from their worries. I always wanted to be seen as nice, kind, considerate, etc. I don't think I ever knew anything else tbh. Now I'm an adult and I'm almost done with college and every day is harder and harder to get out of bed because I don't truly care about anything. I don't feel like I can do anything anymore. I don't know what I truly want other than whatever is going to give me my next dopamine fix.

Maybe it's an ADHD thing, maybe it's a depression thing, probably a mixture of a few things. I honestly am just having a really shitty time and I want to know if anyone else has ever struggled with this. I tried posting this in the ADHD subreddit, thinking maybe people would relate and help me to understand it a bit better, but it got removed by mods almost immediately which is cool and great.

I moved across the world, settled into a new country and have started my life again. New job, new home, new partner. But I feel myself slipping into a state where I just don’t want to anymore. 

I’m not under privileged, I’m not struggling financially for the most part, I have no reason to feel the way I do but every night I go to sleep with the hope I just don’t wake up. And every morning I do, I’m disappointed.

I’ve tried exercising, meditation, medication, I don’t drink or do drugs outside of my prescription. Nothing seems to correct the way I feel and no amount of external happiness helps as it’s forever fleeting.

I’m trying to feel happy or even fake it until I make it, but it’s at that point now where I just don’t care.

How can I mourn without being mopey?,1,1fslj39,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1fslj39/how_can_i_mourn_without_being_mopey/,2,"This is a general question which I've pondered for a long time, but I'm going to use current events just as an example. I don't know how to mourn a loss/failure/tragedy/etc. without just falling into a ""depression hole"" where I lose hope and faith in anything and everything.

Current example: I grew up in central North Carolina and my grandparents live in the mountains, about halfway between Boone and Asheville. I have a lot of family in that area and Hurricane Helene has devastated the entire region. As far as I can tell, my extended family are all safe and well, but I see images posted by people of small towns I'm very familiar with which have been basically wiped off the map, and part of me wants to mourn the loss, but when I start to let myself do that, I almost always stop myself because it feels like I'm going to spiral downward and out of control. I have lived in western Arkansas the last few years and as such, the storm did not have any direct effect on me, but I feel like I should - and want to - hurt for the people of WNC.

Again, this is just one example of the overall thing which I've thought about for a long time, but how do you get on with your life? Maybe being a little mopey about a bad situation is okay, but where does it end? If I did that for every bad situation, I'd just spend my entire life crying in bed, and that's no way to live.",1727664221.0

Last night my fiancé got upset with me and expressed that I often prioritize myself and my problems over him. The main issue is I like to talk about the things that are bothering me/making me anxious. I have already tried journaling about it. I have a therapy appt later this week. But until then are there any tips on how to manage anxiety without discussing it with/stressing out your loved ones. It’s not fair for me to always dump my anxiety on them.

How do I stop being mediocre and capitalize on my good opportunities? ,1,1fsksoe,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1fsksoe/how_do_i_stop_being_mediocre_and_capitalize_on_my/,1,"My background is of poverty and lack of education , born in a third world country. I came to the United States at the age of 15 and from there I finished high school. Everyone thought I was really smart, and to be fair, I always did well in academic subjects but never really followed through with anything that could have given me a ticket to  success. At some point I had 2 years in college with a perfect 4.0 GPA but only because I cared about that, not the education itself. I ended up dropping once I ""ruined"" my perfect GPA over a B. 

I married my gf from school , after reuniting, and lacking any success with anyone else romantically, not because she was the one. She was a very temperamental person, doing drugs badly at the time, and a bad choice but I was very much interested in having a wife. Things worked out well for sometime, I learned to love her, but I never respected her nor really saw her as an equal. I pushed her to be so, and while it did help her quit drugs and messing around in life, I gave her a bad life and she returned the favor.

Post divorce, I was left with a labor business in the brink of failure but managed to make money by working hard at the physical aspect (once everything was set up). I overworked myself to the point of buying a house (300K loan with an initial expense of 40k). The new expenses compared to the previous rental, pushed my economy to the limits, to the point I had to work 10 to 12 hour work days 6 to 7 days a week. I began to drink heavily after work, until I ran myself to mental exhaustion. I attempted against myself and ended up in a mental hospital 3 times. Afterwards I moved to live with a friend, a very close one. He has helped me a lot to slow down my drinking habits and with his support (emotionally and mentally), and with my last savings, I'm opening a coffee shop.

It's a perfect location, lease is affordable, and running numbers, it's a great position to be in considering the traffic and above all, having my friend and his wife working alongside to help them back too. But I don't see success coming in the near future because I know I'll screw it up. I already am by lacking interest in the things I'm supposed to do. I suck and I feel bad for those around me putting so much faith in me.

I think I'm the luckiest person considering what I am and how well I'm doing despite of my self sabotage. I wish I could change. I wish I could find people like me who had found the pathway to improvement coming from similar circumstances. I am in an ideal situation, having a support system (I don't utilize) and skills (I don't fully use) to create a good life and for those close to me, who really need me.

 My input in life is mediocre and I have gotten more than I deserve. I wish I could be a better person and help those close to me, who somehow, like me and support me a lot. I don't even know how I'm so liked as I am of such poor qualities.

I don't expect a magical cure or an answer to all my issues, but I'd like to now if there are other people who have experienced similar circumstances and what has worked for them.",1727661858.0
